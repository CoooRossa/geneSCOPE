\title{Clip Points to Polygon}
\usage{
clipPointsToPolygon(points, polygon, chunk_size = 5e+05, ncores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A data.frame or data.table of points with columns \code{x} and \code{y}.}

\item{polygon}{An \code{sfc} polygon or \code{sf} polygon object defining the region of interest.}

\item{chunk_size}{Integer. Number of points to process per chunk (default 5e5).}

\item{ncores}{Integer. Number of cores for parallel processing (default 1).}
}
\value{
A data.table (or data.frame) containing only the points from the input that fall within the polygon.
}
\description{
Filters a set of points, returning only those that lie inside a given polygon region. Operates in chunks to handle large datasets efficiently.
}
\details{
This function splits the points into chunks to avoid excessive memory usage during spatial queries. It leverages \pkg{sf} for point-in-polygon checks and can use parallel processing on non-Windows platforms for speed.
