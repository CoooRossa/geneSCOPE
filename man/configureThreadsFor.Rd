\item{task_type}{Character. One of "openmp_only","blas_heavy","mixed","io_bound"}

\item{ncores_requested}{Integer. Requested number of cores}

\item{restore_after}{Logical. Restore previous settings after execution}

\item{operation_type}{Character. One of:
\itemize{
\item "compute_intensive": Heavy computation (Lee's L, correlations)
\item "io_bound": File I/O and data processing
\item "mixed": Mixed workloads
\item "openmp_only": Pure OpenMP, disable BLAS threading
}}

List with thread configuration and optional restore function

Previous thread configuration (invisibly)

\description{
Utilities to safely manage threading in the presence of both OpenMP
and BLAS libraries, preventing conflicts that cause OpenBLAS warnings.

Intelligently configures OpenMP and BLAS threading based on operation type
and system capabilities, with automatic restoration.

Sets up optimal thread configuration for a specific task type
