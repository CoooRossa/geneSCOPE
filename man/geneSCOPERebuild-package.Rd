\title{Packaging scaffolding for the geneSCOPE rebuild}
\description{This package wires together the artifacts required to install and
  validate the geneSCOPE rebuild without moving the algorithm implementations yet.}
\details{geneSCOPERebuild is a metadata-focused placeholder that declares the
  runtime and compilation dependencies of the rebuild, provides a C++ bridge
  for the migrated components, and preserves the build/check scripts while the
  full algorithm modules remain staged in other repositories.}
