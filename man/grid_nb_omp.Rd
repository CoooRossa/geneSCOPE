\title{Build Queen or Rook Neighbourhood List in Parallel}
\usage{
grid_nb_omp(nrow, ncol, queen = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nrow}{Integer. Number of rows in the grid.}

\item{ncol}{Integer. Number of columns in the grid.}

\item{queen}{Logical. TRUE (default) for Queen moves, FALSE for Rook.}
}
\value{
A list of integer vectors of class \code{nb}. Indices are 1-based
  and attributes \code{region.id} and \code{queen} are set.
}
\description{
Creates a spatial neighbourhood list for a rectangular grid using either
  Queen (8-neighbour) or Rook (4-neighbour) connectivity. OpenMP
  parallelisation scales efficiently to millions of grid cells.
}
\details{
Offsets for rook and (optionally) diagonal neighbours are pre-computed and
  applied in an OpenMP \code{for} loop. Each thread accumulates a private
  neighbour vector which is swapped into the main container to avoid
  locking.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
nb <- grid_nb_omp(1024, 1024, queen = TRUE)
head(nb[[1]])
}
}
