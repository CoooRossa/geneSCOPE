\title{Lee's L with cached W × Z}
\usage{
lee_L_cache(Xz, W, n_threads = 1)

lee_L_cache(Xz, W, n_threads = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xz}{n × g numeric matrix of z-scored gene expression (rows = cells)}

\item{W}{n × n sparse weight matrix in dgCMatrix format}

\item{n_threads}{Integer. Number of OpenMP threads (default 1)}
}
\value{
g × g dense matrix of Lee's L statistics.

Dense matrix of Lee's L values
}
\description{
Same output as \code{lee_L} but first caches the
spatially lagged matrix \eqn{WZ} to avoid repeated multiplications.

Same as lee_L but caches spatially lagged matrix for efficiency.
