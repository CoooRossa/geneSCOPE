\title{Construct and Save a Z-score Matrix for Grid × Gene (with optional zero-filling)}
\usage{
norMPG(coordObj, grid_name = NULL, keep_zero_grids = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coordObj}{A list containing \code{coordObj@grid[[grid_name]]$counts} and \code{grid_info}.}

\item{grid_name}{Character. Name of the grid layer to read. If NULL, attempts to auto-detect
a unique sublayer; otherwise must be specified explicitly.}

\item{keep_zero_grids}{Logical. Whether to retain grid cells that have zero counts for all genes
(default TRUE).
- TRUE: Keep all grid cells, even if their \code{counts} are all zero.
- FALSE: Keep only grid cells with at least one gene count > 0.}
}
\value{
The modified \code{coordObj}, with a new entry:
\itemize{
\item \code{coordObj@grid[[grid_name]]$Xz}: the standardized matrix (rows = grid cells, columns = genes).
}
}
\description{
Based on \code{coordObj@grid[[grid_name]]$counts}, construct a “grid × gene” matrix,
perform row normalization (so that each grid’s row sums to 1), then apply column-wise
Z-score standardization. Optionally retain grid cells with all-zero counts. The result
is saved under \code{coordObj@grid[[grid_name]]$Xz}.
