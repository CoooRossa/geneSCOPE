\title{Plot Lee's L vs. Gene Total Count Fold Change (All Gene Pairs)}
\usage{
plotLScatter(scope_obj, grid_name = NULL, lee_stats_layer = NULL, title = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{scope_obj}{An object containing
\code{scope_obj@grid[[grid_name]]$counts} and
\code{scope_obj@grid[[grid_name]][[lee_stats_layer]]$L}.}

\item{grid_name}{Character (optional). The name of the grid sublayer to use.
If NULL and \code{scope_obj@grid} has exactly one sublayer,
that sublayer is used automatically. Otherwise, it must be provided.}

\item{lee_stats_layer}{Character (optional). The name of the LeeStats layer (e.g., \code{"LeeStats_Xz"}).
If NULL, the function searches for exactly one layer under
\code{scope_obj@grid[[grid_name]]} whose name starts with \code{"LeeStats_"}.
If multiple matches are found, an error is thrown and the user must
supply \code{lee_stats_layer} explicitly.}

\item{title}{Character (optional). Plot title. Defaults to
\code{"Lee's L vs. Fold Change (All Gene Pairs)"} if NULL.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object showing a scatterplot of Lee's L vs. fold change
for all gene pairs (i < j).
}
\description{
For a given \code{scope_obj}, extract the Lee's L matrix from
\code{scope_obj@grid[[grid_name]][[lee_stats_layer]]$L}.
Summarize each gene's total count across all grid cells from
\code{scope_obj@grid[[grid_name]]$counts}. For every gene pair (i, j) with i < j,
compute Lee's L and the fold change of their total counts
(fold change = max(total_i, total_j) / min(total_i, total_j), ≥ 1).
Finally, plot a scatterplot with Lee's L on the x-axis and fold change on
the y-axis, using a 25\% gray background and publication-quality aesthetics.
